# k8s-exercise-backend
Companion app for exercise https://github.com/techgrounds/Cloud-Curry/blob/main/Containerization/netflix.md

This repository aims to provide a backend for the Netflix Clone exercise in a container. It contains the tools to build the backend-container and make it available through gcr.io.

## Sources
The Dockerfile used is based upon the following article provided by [Spring](https://spring.io/guides/topicals/spring-boot-docker/#_multi_stage_build). It is simplified as the extraction of the jar-file was not working. It is the basic execution of the jar-file in the end.

## Usage

Get the container from [github](ghcr.io/techgrounds/n5xc-backend).
